Description:
    This compute controller is responsible for performing a parallel Radix sort of an SSBO 
    according to a structure-specific element.  For example, suppose there is a Particle 
    structure with position, velocity, mass, etc.  If I want to sort the particles in 3D space 
    according to a Z-order curve, then I will want to sort the particles by Morton codes.
    
    Sorting by parallel Radix sort requires going over all the bits in the data to be sorted 
    one by one, each time:
    (1) Getting a single bit value
    (2) Performing a parallel prefix scan by work group
    (3) Performing a parallel prefix scan over all the work group sums
    (4) Sorting the data according to the prefix sums.

    If I want to sort the original structures, then I can't just sort by some integer.  I need 
    to associate the data that is being sorted with the original structure.  Enter the 
    IntermediateData structure, which stores a uint (data to sort over, such as a 
    3D-position-derived Morton code) and the index into the buffer that the structure originally 
    came from.

    This class handles the multiple compute shaders that need to be called at each step of the 
    sorting process.  The sorting process requires knowing how big the original buffer is and 
    exactly which buffer is being sorted, so an instance of this class will only be useful for a 
    single OriginalDataSsbo.  Compute shaders are not as flexible as CPU-bound shaders, so you 
    have to hold their hand, and the consequence is high coupling.  
    
    The benefit is that it can sort 1,000,000 structures in less than 6 milliseconds (at least 
    for the OriginalData structures that I'm using in this demo).
