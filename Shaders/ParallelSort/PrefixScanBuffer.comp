Description:
    This is the data that is being scanned AND that is being altered into a prefix sum.
    See explanation of sizes in PrefixSumSsbo.

    Note: The totalNumberOfOnes value between the buffers is set during in the middle of the 
    prefix scan algorithm of the PrefixSumsPerGroup array in the same manner that entries in 
    PrefixSumsPerGroup are set in the middle of each work group's prefix scan of 
    PrefixSumsWithinGroup.  It is used along with uPrefixSumsWithinGroupSize in 
    SortIntermediateData.comp to determine the total number of 0s and thus the offset the 1s.

    Prefix sum of 0s = index into PrefixSumsWithinGroup - value at that index (sum of 1s)

    Why is there a "number of 1s" variable being used to determine the number of 0s?  Because 
    (1) The 1s go after the 0s, so the index for the 1s requires knowing how many 0s came before
    (2) You can sum all the 0s in the world and you will still get 0.  Sure, it is possible 
    to count the number of 0s, but then you'll have to use a counting algorithm, not a sum 
    algorithm.
